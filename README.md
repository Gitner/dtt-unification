# dtt-unification
Digital terrestrial television is a right for everyone, currently the streaming is managed by individual providers that add further advertising and do not make the use of the service as it should be, instantaneous.
The streaming platform will be born and group all the free to air channels together, it must be liberalized, as is the case for broadcasting over the air

The European Union must make it available for free on a unified platform eventually managed by individual nations, it is an inalienable right to have access to free information and currently streaming is cumbersome and difficult to use, the goal of this project is to use the platform even with a television where the standard signal is not sufficient or in any case does not allow normal viewing of TV channels
